### The Reality of Game Development


The article, [The Reality of Game Development](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-reality-of-game-development), introduces readers to a less-romanticized view of the industry than the one that they may have, highlighting the risks and practical challenges that comes with being a developer in the field. The article explains that while the playability and art of a game can be a very magical experience, success is not guaranteed even for the biggest studios, and the design of a game has to rely on more than passion. Developers need to design their games with the limits of following design principles, testing, marketing, and trends. Misunderstanding market appeal can easily ruin the success of a great game, as hundreds of incredible games are made yearly, and many never get off the ground. Although a game may have artistic appeal, understanding the science behind what can make a decent game successful is equally as important. Success in the games industry is fragile, so studios and individual developers have to prioritize adaptability and flexibility.
